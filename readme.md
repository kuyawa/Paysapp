### Goals:

Reach the whole world sending Stellar assets using Whatsapp as a wallet. With a few simple text commands you can send any asset to your family and friends, businesses, fundraising campaigns, any recipient, any currency, any asset, any time. Money can't be simpler and that's the whole concept of a truly modern banking experience, welcome to Paysapp.


### Description:

In a few words, just take a look:

**Pay 100 to Caroline**

That's how simple Paysapp is. With a handful of actions you can send money all over the world, check your balance, handle multiple assets, trade them in the Stellar marketplace, and to make it even simpler you can use your phone number or any vanity name you like.

The messaging platform will be provided by Whatsapp and the unbreakable ledger by the Stellar Network, a match made in heaven.

In order to test the platform you have to add +14155238886 to your Whatsapp contacts and send the following message `join official-pleasure` to access the testing sandbox. Once greeted by the Whatsapp bot all comunication will be between our servers and your commands, now send `register Caroline` to activate your wallet and we will create a Stellar account with 10000 XLM for you to test and that name will be reserved for you if not already taken, then people can send money directly to your Paysapp name as in `pay 100 to Caroline`. Isn't that awesome?

From now on all you have to do is use the `pay` command to send money all over the world. `Pay 100 to George` and I will receive 100 USD in my account. The default asset is XLM but you can easily change it to any of the 150 currencies in the world with this simple command `currency USD` using any 3 char currency code. Want to send GOLD or SLVR? GOAT or HUGS? Easy peasy, we can trade any imaginable asset in the Stellar Exchange, but that'll take a bit longer, we're working on all the amazing features a modern wallet should have, for now type `help` to see all actions available.

Paysapp is available in seven of the most used messaging apps in the world and each one has a very unique way of starting conversations with bots, we will go one by one so you can open as many accounts as you want depending on your needs.

# Whatsapp

By far the most used and at the same time most complicated to setup of all since it relies on Twilio for the messaging platform, right now it requires joining a sandbox while we register a business account so they can assign us a phone number for the bot:

- Add Twilio's number `+1 415 523 8886` to your chats 
- Type `join official-pleasure` as keyword to join the sandbox
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

# Telegram

The easiest of all and the richest experience for a messaging bot:

- Add `Paysappbot` to your chats
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

Alternatively you could visit this link https://t.me/paysappbot and add the bot from there.

# Keybase

Another simple platform and very easy to use, already has a Stellar wallet available to their users, the more the merrier:

- Add `Paysapp` to your chats
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

# Matrix using Riot.im

A rising open source network selected by Mozilla to be their messaging platform of choice:

- Send a direct message to `@paysapp:matrix.org`
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

# Discord

The preferred platform for gamers around the world is a little complicated with their authorization process:

- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

# Slack

The most used messaging app in the enterprise world is also a bit complicated, there is no direct way to add a bot to your chats, instead add it to your workspaces using an authorization link:

- Click the [Paysapp button](https://paysapp.net/slack) to add it to your workspace
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info

# Twitter

A popular choice for following interesting people and being up to date in news is also easy to setup:

- Just send a direct message to `@PaysappNet`
- Type `register YourName` to open your account
- Type `help` for more info


That's how you setup your Paysapp account in the most used messaging apps in the world. You can have as many accounts as you need, for personal or business use, but remember every app needs a unique name so payments and notifications find their way to the right destination.
